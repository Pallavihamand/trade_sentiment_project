# Trade Sentiment Project

## Overview
This project performs **trade sentiment analysis** using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
It collects financial data, processes it, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes trends to support trading decisions.

## Files in the Project
- `Trader_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations.  
- `app.py` – Python script for additional processing (if needed).  
- CSV files:  
  - `fear_greed_index.csv`  
  - `historical_data.csv`  
  - `final_merged_dataset.csv`  
  - `trader_clusters.csv`  

> **Note:** The CSV files are large (tracked with Git LFS) and contain the full dataset used in analysis. GitHub may not preview them, but they work fine locally.

## How to Run

2. Install the required packages:
